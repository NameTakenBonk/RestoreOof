# RestoreOof
Roblox recently removed the oof sound so now you can restore the iconic "OOF" sound!

# How to use it:

**Recommended to have python version 3+**

**Download the ** `main.exe`

This is pretty simple to use.
You will a path to you roblox file, this is easy to do simply go to you search bar and find roblox. Then you will need press "Open File Location"

If you haven't ran `main.exe` then run after that paster in your path which is the path you copied in file explorer.

That should be it, if there are any errors or bugs report it in `issues`.
